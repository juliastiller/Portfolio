# A Multivariate Analysis of NBA Player Data

## Overview

This repository contains the code and materials for my analysis of NBA player-level data from the 2021-2022 season, conducted as my final project for my Multivariate Statistical Methods class. My goal is to leverage multivariate techniques to examine a variety of performance metrics and answer questions like sources of variation, indicators of skill, ability to forecast, and classifications of teams. The insights gleaned from this exploration will transcend traditional box score metrics to improve upon player evaluation, team management, and strategic planning.
